## Why this repo?
Hi there! If you are looking at this page, you may have become frustrated at some point, by either pretty or ugly plots. 
For the ugly plots, I just want to pull the data from them and make the plot myself.
If the plots are nice, all I want is a high-resolution version, or change some axis label, etc.
In any case, we all need the raw data and the raw code to make all plots ever more pretty forever!
This is an attempt to that, so I give you the code used in my PhD thesis.

Like the idea of sharing your nicest general dark matter plots? Why not make your own file, and add it to a pull request.
Or at least publish your raw points somewhere, so that we can eliminate the fine craft of curve tracing.

Sharing data is the future, stealing plots is OK! Just don't forget to properly reference!

## What's in here?
Good question! Here's a list:

  * **Abundances**: a first shot at a plot showing the freeze-out atomic abundances of the first few elements, as a function of baryon fraction. This is not quite finished. Fix me!
  * **Argon_waveforms**: simulated argon waveform pulse shapes.
  * **Freezeout**: the famous dark matter abundance vs 'time' in the early universe.
  * **Planck**: the CMB power spectrum, measured by Planck.
  * **Rates**: WIMP-nucleus scattering rates, taking into account the form factor. Focused at xenon and argon, but may be extended.
  * **RotationCurve**: rotation curve of M33.
  * **TPCs**: dual-phase xenon TPCs as a function of time. This shows the limit vs time, as well as field. Please update once nT and LZ kick in!
  * **Velocities**: isothermal WIMP velocity distribution, with and without Earth motion, and its modulation.
  * **Xenon path length**: the path length of radiation in liquid xenon and in water.
